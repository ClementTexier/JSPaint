# JSPaint
A drawing app made in JS


# Work in progress

This project is currently in standby. I was coding it in order to learn how to use JavaScript better. I need a custom
color selector, and I don't want to use one that can be found on the internet. I will continue this project once my
homemade color selector will be done. The color selector will also be uploaded on GitHub ;)

## Coming soon

-Smoother lines

-Color palette + custom color picker

-More tools

  -Sizeable brush

  -New brush shapes

-Bug fixes
