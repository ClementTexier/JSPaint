# JSPaint
A drawing app made in JS


# Work in progress

I finaly decided to use a JS script in order to have a custom color picker (jscolor.com).
I tried to find a way to code this myself for several days now, and I still can't figure
how to do this. The script I use is not part of this git project, so If you want to install
this project, make sure to download the JS script from it's website, and place it in the "js"
folder.

## Coming soon

-Smoother lines
