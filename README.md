# JSPaint
A drawing app made in JS


# Work in progress

This project is currently paused. I was coding it in order to learn how to use JavaScript better. I need a customcolor
selector in order to ensure IE and Edge support, and I don't want to use one that can be found on the internet.I will
continue this project once my homemade color selector will be done. The color selector will also be uploaded on GitHub
;)
